Tips: It is highly recommended to provide pictures or videos about the issue.

A picture is worth a thousand words. The picture contains a lot of information, including the symptoms of the problem, the specific quest, and what language your client uses. These details are often ignored when describing in language.

We have several examples. When describing in language, developers have been unable to figure out what exactly happened. When the screenshot was sent, the problem was cleared immediately.

You can drag the image directly into the Github input box.

**Please delete these words before submitting.**
